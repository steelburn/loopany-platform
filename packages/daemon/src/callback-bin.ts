/**
 * The `loopany` PATH entry that claude calls back through during a run.
 *
 * The old approach wrote a self-contained CJS shim (`SHIM_SOURCE`) into every
 * run's `<workdir>/.loopany/bin/` — a second, byte-for-byte copy of callback.ts'
 * fetch logic, and it polluted each run's workdir. Instead we write ONE tiny
 * wrapper at daemon boot that RE-EXECS this daemon's own CLI, so:
 *   - callback logic lives only in callback.ts (single source of truth), and
 *   - the run's workdir stays clean (nothing is written into it).
 *
 * The wrapper is launch-agnostic: it replays exactly how the daemon was started
 * (`execPath` + `execArgv` + entry script), so `npx @crewlet/loopany`,
 * `node dist/cli.js`, and `tsx src/cli.ts` all resolve `loopany report …` back
 * to runCallback (execArgv carries the tsx loader in dev, so the .ts entry runs).
